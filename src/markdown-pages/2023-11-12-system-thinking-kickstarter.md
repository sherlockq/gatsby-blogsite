What's system thinking? It's the realisation that individual events are not the
cause but the result of a wider system traced back to way earlier. It's when
more focus are put on the interactions of parts rather than themselves.

"Thinking in Systems" is a very introductory work from past Donella H. Meadows,
who is a key figure in this domain. It briefly explains how to spot a system,
how it's modelled by researchers with two types of feedback loops, balancing
and reinforcing loops. Plus the leverage points to change a system ordered in
effectiveness.

However it's so introductory that my key question of how to analyze and reason
a system in reality from collective haviours to regional conflicts. I'll come
back once more references are studied.
