It has been revised for 9 times, which is self explanatory of its value: NEWS
The Politics of Illusion (10th Edition). Before summarize the highlights of the
book, I have to mention that throughout the time of reading I feel the content
could be several fold compressed. The limited historic evidence is repeated in
different chapter with different way, while there's various recap of similar
ideas across the book. A few short articles might be more than enough to cover
the same ideas. Nevertheless, the mundane of the narrative won't shadow the
value of the book.

The book is trying to reveal the detrimental news quality's impact to democracy
and the reasoning behind. In a nutshell, it's a negative feedback system
consisting of total free marketing of news industry, fundamental flaw of
impartiality reporting, growing sophistication of political news spun and
deteriorating popular addiction to social media.

The recent decades see a few key legislations changes to lift the regulation on
the scale of private ownership of media. The full free marketing of the news
industry, in other words, by economy of scale, encourage the lowering of the
cost by all means, which inevitably reduces the quantity and quality of
investigative journalism. On the other hand, news media relies on the
coming-without-cost feed of politician to fill the content gap.

Here comes the flaw of impartiality, which was meant to be a foundation of news
neutralisation, to be abused by partisan, or non intellectual opinions.
Journalists are turned away from putting their own opinions into reporting, but
have to rely on different sides to provide opinions. That allows even the most
ridiculous nonsense appears to be at same weight as intellectual words. This is
a contradictory situation which could be argued as a triumph of freedom of
speech by the less accepted non-main stream.

However, not only the conspiracists abuse the impartiality, so called spin
expert is the real expert, who are hired by politicians to feed the news media
and manipulated the popular thoughts with long time study of the popular
psychology and news system. All together lead to the current shape of news,
full of biases:

Four information biases in digital era's news
- Personalization
- Dramatization
- Fragmentation
- Politics as a game

Last but not least, even the author is trying to stay neutral about social
media and sees that as a new way of reporting, I sense the inevitable
scepticism of popularism. People choose what they'd like to hear, not the
complex non binary answer of real world. Social media amplifies the bipolar
tendency and information bubble.

There are some other curious facts mentioned in the book, which don't fit in
the argument directly while I found interesting
- The more interest into a topic, the more aligned with official view.
  Regardless of education.
- Depending on the topics, significant part of survey participants won't get
  upset if their choice didn't turn out to be final policy.

For later: comparative study of US and China news system

How different are the ultimate goal of the politics news in China and America?
Probably now that much, even the style and content varies dramatically. With
the joining of social media as source of news on both sides, ironically the
style are becoming assimilated as well.
