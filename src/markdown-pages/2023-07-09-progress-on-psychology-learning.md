Conscious control of emotion has been a ever-lasting struggle with myself. Many
times I find myself in the middle of aftermath of instinctive emotional
response, bewildered why it ended up there.

On top of that, in less serious but more common situation, I consistently doubt
my judgements of surroundings as my second nature. The world is just so complex
and people simply only see things from their own perspective don't we?

Regarding digging deeper into the inner self, there are mainly three schools of
approaches.

1. Religions promise self control and inner peace by enforcing yielding to a
   higher existence and unquestioned belief. For me the extra complexity of the
   infallible being and loss of freedom of questioning is not really compatible
   with the path I've been trekking through.
2. Spiritual practices without the burden of belief in an being. They are based
   on heuristic "wisdom" of our own existence from distant past, after the
   modern packaging for the benefit of commercial gain is stripped. Yoga is
   most well known and Mindfulness is getting some traction recently.
3. Psychological studies, of which the study of cognition is most relevant. For
   the time being this is my go-to solution due to its compatibility with my
   reasoning system. However I won't rule out practices from the previous two
   schools, after all more I know of how the brain might work, more I see the
   limit of consciousness could reach.

"The Blindspots Between Us" is a great book covering the relatively recent
findings especially remedies to the issue of cognitive biases. As a happy
coincidence it provides an answer to emotion control by explaining the cause
behind, hence the awareness of the cause works as a self-triggering reminder
when emotion comes.

Specifically, it dubs our two thinking systems as autopilot and intentional
system, two minds in one body. Autopilot is the one in charge of spontaneous
response but was formed since prehistoric era when survival in the wild is the
top priority. Intentional system is the one when you believe you're thinking,
the one reading this text, the "I".

However, we, as the intentional system, is oblivious to when and how the
autopilot system is working, but only witness the mess left behind after
autopilot system has cooled down.

The realisation of that fact helps me to live with the emotion, rather than
suppressing it. It takes continuous practice but in the end will work as a
defence system that the intentional system will join as soon as possible as a
bystander and gradually intervene just by the presence. This approach could be
categorised as one strategy of "Emotional regulation". Obviously whoever has
been struggled on emotion control knows strategy is never the challenge,
training yourself to trigger the strategy is. I believe this is first time I
might have found that trigger.

The other thing mentioned is mindfulness meditation. There have been seemly
credible studies showing the mental even physical benefit from mindful
meditation. I had picked up the habit of practicing 20 minutes of meditation
daily but dropped after a while. From my own experience I can't say the
practice alone is helping however keeping the habit alone might be a good
indicator your intentional system is still in control.

Anyway, it won't be fair if the main focus of the book is not covered, which
is:

Biases

- Attribution error: Attribute others' behaviours to personality rather than
  situations. Attribute self's behaviours the other way around.
- Bystander effect. The more bystander present, the less likely individual
  would act. Give out directions directly.
- etc.

Solutions:
- Delay reactions
- Probabilistic thinking, consider the base rate of something happens.
- Alternative explanation
- Consider past experience
- Setting policy
- Make a commitment
- Practicing mindfulness meditation
